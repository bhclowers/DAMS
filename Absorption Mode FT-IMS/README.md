## The following set of scripts accompany the manuscript focusing on the benefits afforded to the FT-IMS by phase correction using the attached absorption mode processing script. Unzipping of the mzML is needed for the script to function.  

### *Absorption mode Fourier transform ion mobility mass spectrometry multiplexing combined with half window apodization windows improves resolution and shortens acquisition times.*
