## Simulation of a Quadrupole Mass Filter 
### Includes a few different approaches to calculating a stable ion trajectory in of ion in a quadrupole
### The approaches outlined in the associated jupyter notebooks were inspired by some helpful conversations by Rando (Ardara Technologies) and the IGOR scripts posted by the Prof. Jiminez (University of Colorado, Boulder)
### These are not intended as rigorous simulations but should reasonable first approaximations.  Remember, quadrupoles are calibrated instruments and these scripts may help demonstrate some of the core principles associated with sinusoidal operation of the quads. 
#### Additional educational characteristics to notice include the initial kinetic energy of the ion and the number of frequency cycles experienced by an ion.
