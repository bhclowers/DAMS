## Files demonstrating the Masked Multiplexing Approach

#### Masked multiplexing transform and adaptive removal of artifact for the 1822 m/z ion in tune mix. The shaded vertical lines represent areas in the transformed vector that exhibit high degrees of variability (C). Minimizing (i.e. deweighting) of those data points maximizing signal to noise ratio in the top trace spectrum shown in (C). A by-product of this method is that the portion of the spectrum containing actual peaks has a low degree of variability. This spectrum further demonstrates the concepts in Figure 3 and even demonstrates the capacity to preserve peak tails. The raw transform is shown in B. with the baseline amplified by a factor of 10 and shown within the inset plot.
