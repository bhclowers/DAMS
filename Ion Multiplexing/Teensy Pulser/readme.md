The code in this directory is intended for use with a Teensy 4.1 which is a highly capable microcontroller. 
The Arduino code will expose the variables used to establish a synchronized pulsing system that outputs 
a sequence based upon a user-defined clock. 

When paired to the jupyter notebook, this repository can be used to implement a portion of the HT-IMS experiment.
